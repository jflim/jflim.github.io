Here's my challenge for the next few weeks. 
I need to have an idea about what's going on in the world and I need an outlet to create.
So I'm going to be taking what is trending in the US and will try to write about it
using a title generator as my blog title.

Here will be the steps I'll be taking:
1. Look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) and pick a trend interesting to me.
2. Use [Title-Maker](https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker) to generate a title with the trend.
3. Create and entertain people [and myself ;)]
